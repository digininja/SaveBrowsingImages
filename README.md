# Save Browsing Files

Extension for Burp to automatically save files of selected MIME types to disk.

Set the MIME type(s) you want to save and the location for the files, and then all files that match the given type(s), either by specified content type or by inferred type, will be automatically saved to disk as you browse around.

## TODO

- Write the URL the file came from to the output log along with the filename.
- Change the output textarea to one of Burp's built in nice ones rather than a plane one.
